Question 1.1
-----------
While HTML source code shows the script to display table with data, the DOM inspections shows this script AND the the generated table and data that are now integrated into DOM. I would use the DOM inspector if I want to quickly check the DOM or make sure that the script in HTML ran correctly because the structured representaiton of the document makes this task easy. On the other hand, HTML source is useful if I want to understand what scripts generated certain elements in the DOM.  

Question 1.2
-----------
This table is generated by the script within the HTML source code. The following list shows the specific lines of code that generated each element:    
Table:  
var table = d3.select("body").append("table"),  
    thead = table.append("thead")  
                .attr("class", "thead");  
    tbody = table.append("tbody");    

Headers:  
var columns = Object.keys(data[0]);  
thead.append("tr").selectAll("th")  
          .data(columns)  
        .enter()  
          .append("th")  
          .text(function(d) { return d; })  
          .on("click", function(header, i) {  
            tbody.selectAll("tr").sort(function(a, b) {  
              return d3.descending(a[header], b[header]);  
            });  
          });  

Rows:  
var rows = tbody.selectAll("tr.row")  
                .data(data)  
                .enter()  
                .append("tr").attr("class", "row");  

Cells:  
var cells = rows.selectAll("td")  
    .data(function(row) {  
        return d3.range(Object.keys(row).length).map(function(column, i) {  
            return row[Object.keys(row)[i]];  
            });  
        })  
    .enter()  
    .append("td")  
    .text(function(d) { return d; })  

The original data is stored in a JSON file called countries_2012.json that is stored in the "data" directory.   

Question 2.1
-----------
I would not use checkboxes to filter other columns because all the other columns have numeric values, which can be better filtered by using a slider to set the range. However, the exception to this is in cases where a range of values are already defined by categories. (Think of classification of developed countries, developing countries, and third world countries based on GDP)

Question 3.1
-----------
I would not aggregate the table using other columns because other columns are defind by numeric values and there is no common properties that assign countries into groups. (Once again, the exception would be made if there is a predefined classfication based on GDP, life_expectancy, etc.)

Question 4.1
-----------
The attribute "years" hold gdp, life expectancy, population, and various export data for each year from 1995 to 2012 for the selected country.

Question 5.1
-----------
While the visualization capability of HTML is largely limited to drawing rectangular shapes using div's, SVG supports a wide range of visualization and animation that makes story telling on data illustrative and clear. Whoever, SVG also has a large specification that makes it more difficult to develop visualization. 

Question 7.1
-----------
Visualization is appropriate in cases that allow users to explore the data with interaction and gain useful insights. An example of appropriate case would be a visualization of your personal finance that allows you to explore the sources and classification of your monthly expenses. 

Question 7.2
-----------
Using interactivity, the users can select a subset of data, track changes over time, and see the breakdown of the data, all in visually conveying ways to explore data.

Question 7.3
-----------
Visualization takes great effort to develop which means it is often not appropriate for using to answer well defined question on well-defined dataset or to make decisions needed in minimal time. In addition, visualization still relies on human interpretation to convey information which means it would do a poor job if the visualization is created in complicated graphics. 

Question 7.4
-----------
Data semantics are important for visualization because the program needs structured data with defined data type and category to understand what each data stand for. Otherwise, visualization on unstructured data would be either impossible or convey nonsense to the users. 

Question 7.5
-----------
a) quantitative  
=,≠, >, <, +, -, x, ÷  

b) categorical  
=, ≠  

c) Ordinal  
=, ≠, >, <  

Question 7.6
-----------
Visual variables that are associative are color and shape.

Question 7.7
-----------
Visual variables that are quantitative are position, tilt, and size.
