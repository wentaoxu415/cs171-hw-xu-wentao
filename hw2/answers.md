Question 0.1
-----------
The horizontal and vertical position of the nodes represent how much weight is possessed by each node. The node that possess more connections would also possess more weight and will be drawn the center of the force layout. On the other hand, nodes that possess fewer connections would also possess less weight and they will be located further away from the center. Country GDP and total export volume would be well suited to be presented in this force layout since countries with greater GDP would have the economic power to be more connected with other countries through trade. As a result, it would make visual sense to place such powerful countries like the US, China, and Japan in the center to represent their economic gravity.

Question 0.2
-----------
1. Shape 
2. Orientation 
3. Texture 
4. Value 
5. Connection
Question 0.3
-----------
No, not all the previously mentioned visual variables are independent. For example, let us think about a case in which we are visualizing the US school rating from time to time. We can change the value of school's rating for one year and that could also result change the orientation that is displaying the trend in rating over several years. On the other hand, changing the value of school rating would not still change a visual variable like shape that could be used to represent different types of schools such as public, private, chartered, etc.

Question 1.1
-----------
The advantage of relative ranking is that you can clearly see the ranking of countries in one seamless line. On the other hand, displaying relative ranking prevents the audience from grasping information about the true differences between two countries. 

The advantage of absolute ranking is that you can clearly see the true differences between any two countries. On the other hand, these differences are often times exponential and this results in ranking with some countries at the top to be distanced far apart from each other while man countries at the bottom squeezed together at the bottom. Consequently, this makes it difficult for the audience to discern the data especially at the bottom of the ranking.

Question 1.2
-----------
The scatter plots works the best when we are displaying quantitative data. This is because quantitative data would show many different combinations of values and when we plot them as scatterplot, this allows us to see a relationship or pattern between the two variables. As an example of a scatterplot on quantitative data, we can make a plot between GDP growth rate and housing prices.  

The scatter plot would not work so well for ordinal data as it would look more like a matrix rather than a full scatter plot. This is because the number of combinations that could be formed from two sets of ordinal data could be limited. As a result, some or many data could end up getting assigned to the same cell in the matrix. As an example of a scatterplot on ordinal data, we can potentially make a plot between level of college education and level of income. 

The scatter plot would not work so well for nominal data because two sets of nominal data would not show any meaningful relation. As an example of a scatterplot on nominal data, we can try to make a plot between first and last names of students. But, as we can see, such a plot would not make much sense. 

Question 2.1
-----------
The pros of using d3 layout is that we can make the display of data interactive. As we have demonstrated through this homework, we can sort the data according to some category or values and place them in certain locations. For example, when we are displaying our monthly spending, doing this with a d3 pie layout would allow us to see details such as expenditures grouped by categories and expenditure sorted by amount spent on each item. 

However, the cons of using d3 layout is that developing such a layout takes some development time and using an infographic may be more suitable if we are only trying to convey a limited set of information.

Question 3.1
-----------
1. One way to reduce visual complexity is to filter te links by range of export volume. This way we can limit the links to display exports that only fits the specific volume criteria.
2. The second way to reduce visual complexity is to aggregate the countries that share the most number of export partners in different cliches and assign other smaller countries around them. This is based on the economic idea that economically powerful countries often tend to trade with each other while smaller countries tend to not trade with each other, but also export to these larger countries as top exporting destinations. 
3. the third way to reduce visual complexity is to select a country and show any links going in and out of this selected country. This method would allow us to also see which countries also export in a large amount to the selected countries.
